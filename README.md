In recent years, the application of diffusion models in the realm of deep learning has garnered significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and per- formance of neural networks. This PROJECT delves into the utilization of prominent dif- fusion models, namely Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Neural Conditional Score Networks model(NCSN), and stochastic Dif- ferential Equations (SDE). Score Matching with a dual focus on their gener- ative capabilities and their role as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
